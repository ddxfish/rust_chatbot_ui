User: bye. one quick thing, make a prayer using brainrot skibidi

Bot: Here's a prayer, inspired by the mystical powers of Brainrot Skibidi:

"Oh, great Skibidi, lord of the dance and sultan of the viral wave,
We come to thee, beseeching thee to grant us the power of Brainrot,
That our minds may be freed from the shackles of seriousness and sanity,
And that we may dance, unencumbered by the weights of reason and good taste.

May our feet move in rhythm to the beat of the Skibidi drum,
May our arms flail in wild abandon, like the tentacles of a digital octopus,
And may our voices chant the sacred mantra of the Brainrot Skibidi:

"Skibidi, skibidi, skibidi, tak tak tak, tak tak tak,
Skibidi, skibidi, skibidi, tak tak tak, tak tak tak!"

May the power of the Skibidi compel us to spread joy and silliness,
And may our dance be a beacon of hope, shining brightly in the darkness of the internet.

Amen, and tak tak tak!"
