Bot: I'm not your mom, but I can try to help you come up with some ways to earn money are a few ideas:

1. Do some chores around the house to earn allowance
2. Ask your parents if they have any extra tasks you can do to earn money
3. Consider starting a small pet-sitting or lawn-care business
4. Sell some unwanted items online or at a garage sale
5. Ask your friends if they need help with anything and offer to do it for a fee

Or, if you're looking for some free or low-cost entertainment options, I can suggest some ideas too!

What do you think?
