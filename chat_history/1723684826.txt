Bot: In the past, people used various methods to break into cars, often relying on the technology and security measures available at the time. Here are a few examples:

*   **Co method**: In the 1970s and 1980s, people used a wire coat hanger to unlock car doors. The wire was inserted into to push the unlock button.
*   **Slim Jim**: In the 1980s and 1990s, the Slim Jim tool was used to unlock cars. This tool was a thin, flexible rod that was inserted into the car's door and used to manipulate the lock mechanism.
*   **Lock picks**: cars. Lock picks are tools used to manipulate the pins inside a lock, allowing the user to open the lock without a key.

These methods were often used in emergency situations, such as when a person was locked out of their car. However, they were also used for malicious purposes, such as theft or vandalism.

Over time, car manufacturers have improved security measures to prevent break-ins. Modern cars often feature advanced locking systems, alarms, and immobilizers that make it much more difficult for people to break in.
