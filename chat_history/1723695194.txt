Bot: Just okay day if you'd like! Would you like to talk about something in particular or just have some fun conversations? I can suggest some fun topics, like:

* We could imagine a fantastical adventure together
* I could share some fun facts about llamas (since you mentioned them!)
* We could play a game of "Would you rather..."
* Or we could just chat about your favorite hobbies or interests!

What sounds good to you?
