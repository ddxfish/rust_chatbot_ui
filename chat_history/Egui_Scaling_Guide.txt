User: does rust egui have ui scaling capability?

<<<MESSAGE_SEPARATOR>>>

Bot: Yes, egui (an immediate-mode GUI library for Rust) has built-in support for UI scaling.

You can use the `pixels_per_point` method to set the scaling factor for pixels per point (1/72 of an inch) used for rendering the UI. By default, egui uses a pixels_per_point value of 1.0, which means 1 pixel per point.

To scale the UI, you can set a different value for `pixels_per_point`. For example, to scale the UI by 2x, you can set `pixels_per_point` to 2.0:
```rust
let mut egui = egui::CtxRef::new();
egui.set_pixels_per_point(2.0);
```
This will scale the entire UI, including text, icons, and other graphical UI relative to the current scaling factor. For example, to scale the UI by an additional 50%:
```rust
egui.scale(1.5);
```
This will multiply the current scaling factor by 1.5, resulting in a total scaling factor of 3.0 (2.0 x 1.5).

eg for scaling the UI, such as `scale_to_fit` and `scale_to_fill`, which can be used to automatically scale the UI to fit or fill the available screen space.

It's worth noting that egui's scaling is displays and should produce crisp and clear text and graphics even at high scaling factors.

User: could i make a slider for that?

Bot: Yes, egui. Here's an example of how you can do itCtxRef::new();
let mut scale = 1.0;

egui::CentralPanel::default().show(&mut egui, |ui| {
    ui.label("UI Scaling:");
    ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&mut scale, 0.5..=2.0).text("Scale"));
    egui.set_pixels_per_point(scale);
});
```
In this example, we create a `Slider` widget that allows the user to adjust the `scale` value between  `set_pixels_per_point` method to set the UI scaling factor to the current value of `scale`.

You can also add some text to display the current scaling factor next to the slider:
```rust
ui.label("UI Scaling:");
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&mut scale, 0.5..=2.0).text("Scale"));
ui.label(format!("Scale: {:.1}", scale));
egui.set_pixels_per_point(scale);
```
This will display the current scaling factor as a label next to the slider, with one decimal place.

Note that you can adjust the range of the slider to suit your needs. For example, if you want to allow the user to scale the UI up to 44.0`.
