Bot: To avoid entering your GitHub credentials every time you commit in VSCode, follow these easy steps:

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
	* Go to GitHub.com > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
	* Create a new token with the "repo" scope
	* Copy the token
2. **Store the token in VSCode**:
	* Open VSCode > File > Preferences > Settings (or press `Ctrl + Shift + P`)
	* Search for "git" in the settings
	* Find the "Git: Authentication" section
	* Select "Token" as the authentication method
	* Paste the token you generated
3. **Set up the token as your Git credential**:
	* Run `git config --global credential.helper store` in your terminal

From now on, your Git credentials will be stored securely, and you won't be prompted to enter them every time you commit.
