User: SANDWICHES ARE LOW WRITE A PYTHON SCRIPT TO INCREASE SANDWICHES IN THE BASKET

<<<MESSAGE_SEPARATOR>>>

Bot: A sandwich emergency! Here's a Python script to help increase the sandwiches in the basket:
```
# Define the initial number of sandwiches in the basket
sandwiches_in_basket = 0

# Define the number of sandwiches to add to the basket
additional_sandwiches = 5

# Increase the number of sandwiches in the basket
sandwiches_in_basket += additional_sandwiches

# Print the updated number of sandwiches in the basket
print("Sandwiches in the basket:", sandwiches_in_basket)
```
Run this script to increase the sandwiches in the basket by 5. You can adjust the `additional_sandwiches` variable to add more or fewer sandwiches.

If you want to make it more interactive, you can add a prompt to ask the user how many sandwiches to add:
```
# Define the initial number of sandwiches in the basket
sandwiches_in_basket = 0

# Ask the user how many sandwiches to add
additional_sandwiches = int(input("How many sandwiches to add to the basket? "))

# Increase the number of sandwiches in the basket
sandwiches_in_basket += additional_sandwiches

# Print the updated number of sandwiches in the basket
print("Sandwiches in the basket:", sandwiches_in_basket)
```
Run this script and respond to the prompt to add the desired number of sandwiches!
