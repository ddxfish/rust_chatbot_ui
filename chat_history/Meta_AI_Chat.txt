llama-v3p1-405b-instruct: I'm not Claude, but I'm a similar model. I'm a large language model developed by Meta AI, while Claude is a large language model developed by Anthropic. We're both designed to understand and generate human-like text, but we have different training data, architectures, and fine-tuning objectives.
